# NETWORK_SETUP_AND_OWASP_ENUMERATION_MIDTERMLAB

**Scenario**
As a key member of the Digital Guardian Corp, you are identified by your codename 'Archon'. You belong
to the Arch Angel team, renowned in the industry for their unparalleled skills in the realm of
cybersecurity, specifically, pentesting and security audits.
Your latest assignment is a challenging one, you have been hired by an infamous conglomerate, Evil Co
and Associates. Your mission is to conduct an initial reconnaissance of their digital fortress, to identify
and report any potential vulnerabilities that may exist within their complex network.
Day 1 begins with the gathering of as much publicly available information on Evil Co and Associates as
possible. This process, known as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), involves looking into employee
profiles on LinkedIn, scanning social media for any posts by or about the company, and scouring their
website for potential loopholes. The objective is to build a digital footprint of the company without
alerting them of your activities.
Meanwhile, you also kickstart the Network Enumeration process, mapping out Evil Co's systems,
identifying live hosts, IP addresses, and open ports. This will serve as the blueprint for the next stages of
the operation.
Your actions are monitored and guided by your wise supervisor, Professor Magneto. A veteran in the
field of cybersecurity, Professor Magneto not only provides technical expertise but also keeps the team's
morale high with his witty remarks and encouraging words.
By the end of the week, you have amassed a significant amount of data. You start classifying them
according to relevance and potential exploitability. With your team's help, you conduct preliminary
analysis, noting down potential weak points that could be utilized for the actual penetration testing.
As the week comes to a close, it's time for the crucial task: writing a comprehensive report to Professor
Magneto. The report includes an overview of Evil Co and Associates, the methods used for information
gathering, the blueprint of their network systems, potential vulnerabilities identified, and
recommendations for the next steps.
However, the journey has just begun. With Professor Magneto's approval, Arch Angel will prepare for the
next phase, ready to expose the darkest secrets hidden within Evil Co's digital fortress, and strengthen
their fortifications against cyber threats lurking in the shadows. The mission is risky, but for the Arch
Angel team, it's all in a day's work.Assignment Objectives
